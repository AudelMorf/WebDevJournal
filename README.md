## What is the difference between Git and Github ?

>git is used for tracking changes in source code. Allowing other dev's to working together on non-linear development
>GitHub is a repository hosting service , command line tool , and provides access to other dev's code.

## What is the payoff of using Git and Github ?
> With GitHub someone can copy and try your code and with git they can clone or fork your repository.

## Where do I see myself in 14 weeks?
	  
> Making  full working webpage with buttons and animations , In ***6 month*** getting more knowledge in making a game, and in **a year** from now making my own game with my own code without looking at tutorials 
> 
## Am I Afraid ?
> No I'm excited for this new thirst of knowledge, also very motivated to learn new tips and tricks to get to where i want to be.
## What I wish to accomplish 

> My main gaol is to create a game from scratch to understand the process of what goes into making the game, and hopefully publish it when completed 
> 
## Potential roadblocks
>One of my problems would be I'm not asking enough questions to get the full picture of what is being presented.


# The primary uses for JavaScript 
	

Java is used..

	## for making web applications with a series of switches that dictate what will happen when conditions are made like a game or a web page 

## Positive uses for Javascript

 1. ability to create interactive behavior 
 2. easy to understand
 3. Interoperability (can be embed into a webpage or inside script of another language


# Downsides to using JavaScript
while being an easy to use language, it has it weak links. Some of those links would be  client-Side security, which is when your code is being executed on the client side , bugs that weren't caught after being published can become exploited.

Another weak link would be its **Browser Support** meaning while your code might be working in a browser another browser might interpret it different.
